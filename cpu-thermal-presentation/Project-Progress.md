# CPU & GPU Thermal Management Presentation - Progress

## Redesign Status

We've completely redesigned the presentation based on user feedback:

### From Scrollable Content to Immersive Experience
- ✅ Transformed from scrollable content to unscrollable, immersive slide-based presentation
- ✅ Added 3D models and visualizations using Three.js and React Three Fiber
- ✅ Implemented particle simulations for heat visualization
- ✅ Created interactive elements (power slider affecting temperature)
- ✅ Added animated data visualizations
- ✅ Implemented modern glass morphism UI effects

### Technical Improvements
- ✅ Implemented Three.js with React Three Fiber
- ✅ Created 3D CPU model with heat visualization
- ✅ Added interactive heat distribution visualization
- ✅ Implemented interactive power-to-heat relationship demonstration
- ✅ Added keyboard and mouse navigation support

## Completed Sections

1. **Introduction** ✅
   - Modern layout with 3D CPU model
   - Animated statistics on thermal impact
   - Interactive information cards
   - 3D particle effects for heat visualization

2. **Understanding Heat Generation** ✅
   - Interactive 3D heat map visualization
   - Power-to-heat relationship slider
   - Animated power density chart
   - Key factors display with animations

## Next Steps
1. Create the "Thermal Management Technologies" section with 3D models of:
   - Air cooling solutions
   - Liquid cooling systems
   - Advanced cooling methods
2. Add more interactive 3D visualizations
3. Implement slide transitions with 3D effects
4. Add sound effects for interactions
5. Create a "fullscreen mode" option

## Technical Details
- Using Framer Motion for animations
- Using styled-components for styling
- Using React Router for navigation between sections
- Using TypeScript for type safety
